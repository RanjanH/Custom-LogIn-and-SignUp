# Custom LogIn and SignUp
 Custom Designed Log In and Sign Up page Developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

 This can be used as an Overlay for your website and if you want it to be placed on another page then you can remove the close button.

Below is the line of code for the close button:
 ```<i id="close" class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i>```

The CSS of this button is under the id ```close```. Remove that too if you are removing the button.
